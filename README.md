Due to some technical issue I moved download link back to http://qsys400.com/wrtsfl-write-subfile-code/.

This utility can write IBM i (RPG + SQL) Subfile code for any given SQL select statement with little or no user interaction. 
It takes less than 20 seconds to write complete Subfile code. Check video at top/bottom of this page for more details.
<hr>
<H3>on IBM i:</H3>

After downloading WRTSFL.SAVF from GitHub

FTP SAVF to IBM i as binary file.

Restore Lib SUMIT from this savf. ==> RSTLIB SAVLIB(SUMITG) DEV(*SAVF) SAVF(*LIBL/WRTSFL)

Use menu QSYS400 or command WrtSFL 

Note: If move/copy objects from one lib to other move/copy PF(Tables) with data.
